**Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) Analysis and Energy Integration**

**Project Overview**:
Simulated heat integration in a refinery system to minimize utility consumption using MATLAB.

**Key Highlights**:

- Performed hot and cold stream modeling, calculated heat loads, and plotted composite curves.

- Conducted pinch analysis to identify pinch temperature (60 °C) and heat at pinch (335 kW).

- Estimated hot utility (25 kW), cold utility (0 kW), and energy savings ≈ 93%.

**Heat Exchange Summary**:

S1 -> S3 : 200 kW  
S1 -> S4 : 160 kW  
S2 -> S3 : 135 kW  
S2 -> S4 : 135 kW
